      <p id="tuesday_book_description">All pretending aside, this is one of my favourite children's books in my collection. There is a Rosie the Riveter easter egg, there is social emotional learning, there is complex things for kids, this book has everything. This book is incredibly pro-STEAM in an incredibly accessible way. The only book I have that's better than this one is Ara the Star Engineer, which is about coding and working at Google, but I can't find that one to take a picture of.</p>
