    <h3>How long have you been watching videos for?</h3>
    <p>Don't forget to limit your screen time and to do plenty of indoor and outdoor learning and playing that doesn't involve a computer! Miss Serenica's Very Made Up Rule is that for every 5 minutes of videos, you should try to read 1 book for play for 10 minutes! Here's a handy clock so you don't fall victim to timeblindness.</p>
